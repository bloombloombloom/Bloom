  reset                     Resets the target and holds it in a stopped state.

  eeprom fill [VALUE]       Fills the target's EEPROM with the specified value. The value should be in hexadecimal
                            format: "monitor eeprom fill AABBCC". If the specified value is smaller than the EEPROM
                            memory segment size, it will be repeated across the entire segment address range. If the
                            value size is not a multiple of the segment size, the value will be truncated in the final
                            repetition. The value size must not exceed the segment size.
