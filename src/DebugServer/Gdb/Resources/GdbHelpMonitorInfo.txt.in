  reset                 Resets the target and holds it in a stopped state.

  eeprom fill           Fills the target's EEPROM with a specified value. The value should be specified via the
                        --value option. The value should be in hexadecimal format: "--value=AABBCC". If the specified
                        value is smaller than the EEPROM capacity, it will be repeated across the entire EEPROM address
                        range. If the value size is not a multiple of the EEPROM capacity, the value will be truncated
                        in the final repetition. The value size must not exceed the EEPROM capacity.
